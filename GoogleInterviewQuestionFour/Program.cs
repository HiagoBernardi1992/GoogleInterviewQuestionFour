            //    Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.
            //    Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W, without reordering the remaining characters.
            //    Note: D can appear in any format(list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.
            //    For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = { "able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"}
            //    the correct output would be "apple"
            //    The words "able" and "ale" are both subsequences of S, but they are shorter than "apple".
            //    The word "bale" is not a subsequence of S because even though S has all the right letters, they are not in the right order.
            //    The word "kangaroo" is the longest word in D, but it isn't a subsequence of S.
            //    Learning objectives
            //    This question gives you the chance to practice with algorithms and data structures.It’s also a good example of why careful analysis for Big - O performance is often worthwhile, as is careful exploration of common and worst -case input conditions.
